# nucamp-round-2
Getting my second dose of NuCamp's Full Stack Curriculum. From the Fundamentals all the way to the Full-Stack. Only this time I'm going to do my best to document as much as I possibly can!



## Setup for the Web Dev Fundamentals (HTML, CSS, & JavaScript) (Windows 10)

# VS Code Extensions
- [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

# Git
- `git config --global user.name "{your_username}"`
- `git config --global user.email {your_email}`
- `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "{your_email}"`
- ``eval `ssh-agent -s` ``
- `ssh-add.exe ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
- `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
- Copy the key that prints out and add it to your Github account
- `ssh -T git@github.com` to test out your ssh key.

#### Node Version 14.9.0 WIN10, M1 Macs 15.10.0 or later
Notes: Remember to add your ssh key to the ssh-agent when you first load up VSCode, so that you don't need to keep punching your password in EVERYTIME you make a commit/push.

##### TODO: [x] ~~Write a script that runs the ssh-agent upon starting VSCode.~~
Add this to your ~/.bash_profile(Windows 10 using the git for Windows Client):
```bash
# generated by Git for Windows
test -f ~/.profile && . ~/.profile
test -f ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc

env=~/.ssh/agent.env

agent_load_env () { test -f "$env" && . "$env" >| /dev/null ; }

agent_start () {
    (umask 077; ssh-agent >| "$env")
    . "$env" >| /dev/null ; }

agent_load_env

# agent_run_state: 0=agent running w/ key; 1=agent w/o key; 2= agent not running
agent_run_state=$(ssh-add -l >| /dev/null 2>&1; echo $?)

if [ ! "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] || [ $agent_run_state = 2 ]; then
    agent_start
    eval `ssh-agent -s`
elif [ "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] && [ $agent_run_state = 1 ]; then
    `ssh-add.exe ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
fi

unset env
```
When you first run VSCode it'll ask for your password, after you enter it, VSCode will now automatically add your SSH-Key to the SSH-Agent and you won't have to enter your password whenever you make pushes to your repo. Also, when rebooting, it resets, so kill the terminal before starting to code to allow the script to re-run properly.
