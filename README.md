# nucamp-round-2
Getting my second dose of NuCamp's Full Curriculum. From the Fundamentals all the way to the Full-Stack.

## Setup for the Web Dev Fundamentals (HTML, CSS, & JavaScript) (Windows 10)

### VS Code Extensions
- 

### Git
- `git config --global user.name "{your_username}"
`
- `git config --global user.email {your_email}`
- `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "{your_email}"`
- ``eval `ssh-agent -s` ``
- `ssh-add.exe ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
- `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
- Copy the key that prints out and add it to your Github account
- `ssh -T git@github.com` to test out your ssh key.

#### Node Version 14.9.0 WIN10, M1 Macs 15.10.0 or later
Note: Remember to add your ssh key to the ssh-agent when you first start working on a repo, so that you don't need to keep punching your password in EVERYTIME you make a commit/push.
