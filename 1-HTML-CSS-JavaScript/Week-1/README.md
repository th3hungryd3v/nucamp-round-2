#### Notes:
This week is very light. It's meant to get your Development Environment (VS Code + Extensions) set up, as well as, play with some HTML & CSS.

##### Personal Reflections

- Always remember that there will always be someone who's bigger, faster, stronger, and smarter than you (and vice-versa). But don't let that discourage you. Time is limited.

- Always strive to be better than you were yesterday.

- Always type examples or tutorials out for yourself and see what happens, regardless if it's wrong/right or neither.

- Networking isn't just for routers and switches, get out there and meet with people in your community.
